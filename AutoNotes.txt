Functions are blocks of code that can be reused.

Canvas uses 3 general types of tests

Unit	- Tests functions directly w/out a browser
		- Run really fast
		- Should be the most numerous
		- Devs do this
		- example location: canvas-lms/spec/coffeescripts

Mixed	- Tests things like API
		- Can be a combo of unit setup and auto execution
		- Devs and QA Auto write these
		- example location: canvas-lms/spec/api

Automated
		- Tests Canvas like a user in the browser
		- Run comparatively slowly
		- QA Auto writes the majority, devs write some
		- Location: canvas-lms/spec/selenium
		- Selenium is a framework for automated tests


To run an automated test

- navigate to canvas-lms in console
- be on a branch other than master
  (you can run them in master there's just more room
  for error)
- to run all the tests in a file
  $ bundle exec rspec [full file name]
- to run one test in a file 
  $ bundle exec rspec [full_file_name]:[line_number]

Keywords in automation files
